**Please Read the instructions two times before starting.**

**Follow the instructions very carefully!**

## How it works?

* <strong>Fork</strong> this repo:

https://github.com/curreythomas/cybertron-test.git

* Clone your forked repo down to your local machine

`git clone https://github.com/{yourprofile}/cybertron-test`

* Install dependencies and start server

```
cd cybertron-test
npm install
npm start
```
> Windows Users may need to install browser-sync globally
> `npm install browser-sync --global`

* Use your favorite editor to open the project

You will see 3 js files, called levelx.js and an index.js file.

Open level1.js and start working on the exercises, each time you complete an
exercise go to your browser and refresh the window to see the results.

When you finish the first level to go to the next level, simply uncomment the
level run code in the index.js file and then open the level js file and start
running that level.

## GRADING

Each question is worth 5 points. A total of 100 points is available. The test
will be graded on the following scale:

| GRADING SCALE              | SCORE     |
| -------------------------- | --------- |
| OUTSTANDING                | 95 TO 100 |
| EXCEEDS EXPECTATIONS       | 85 TO 94  |
| MEETS EXPECTATIONS         | 70 TO 84  |
| BELOW EXPECTATIONS         | 60 to 69  |
| DOES NOT MEET EXPECTATIONS | BELOW 60  |

> TO ANSWER ANY GIVEN CHALLENGE CORRECTLY YOU MUST MATCH THE OUTPUT EXACTLY.

MAKE SURE YOU DON'T MISS ANY QUESTIONS.

* LEVEL 1: 7 QUESTIONS
* LEVEL 2: 7 QUESTIONS
* LEVEL 3: 6 QUESTIONS

> CYBERTRON WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH THE EXPECTED OUTPUT OF EACH ANSWER.

When you finish your exam commit and push your answers to your forked repo and
send a link to that repo via Slack directly to your instructor.

## Linter Support

This project supports the `standard` js linter and `prettier`, installing both
projects in your editor will help find typos and bugs. In atom, install the
`linter` and `linter-eslint` packages.
